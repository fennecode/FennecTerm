# FennecTerm (v0.3-a)
#### My CLI-shell | OPEN-SOURCE, FORK AS YOU WISH!
###### Project Discontinued | Re-writing application.

*Created by (still educating developer) Collin, aka. "Fennec/FennecFemboi/Fennecode".*

## Changelog
- Issue: Needs fixing for value verification. If (for example) "char" were input rather than "int" values accidentally, I need to work on prompting user for error, then returning to correct value.
- Issue: Not looping back to main user interaction "FennecTerm" after entering "help" command.
- Feature: N/A
