# UltimateFurryTerminal [v0.4.2]
#### My CLI-shell | OPEN-SOURCE

*Created by (still educating developer) Halogem. Some random app I'm making and I don't know why. lol*

## Changelog
*New Features*
- Finished Rebranding
- Added a doggo to main title
- Made program easier to read

*WIP Features*
- Adding Tetris soon

## Issues
- Issue: Needs fixing for value verification. If (for example) "char" were input rather than "int" values accidentally, I need to work on prompting user for error, then returning to correct value. Will fix later down the line, not important right now.
